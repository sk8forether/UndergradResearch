# UndergradResearch
Some sample code taken from my undergraduate research project in Astrophysics on Modeling Galaxy Clusters.  Note: I have not updated these files since graduating, though my programming has grown by leaps and bounds since.

functions.py contains, as the name suggests, some core functions for the project.

arrows.py, compilation.py, and rotations3.py are the files to run to generate sample images.

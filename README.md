# UndergradResearch
Some sample code taken from my undergraduate research project in Astrophysics on Modeling Galaxy Clusters.

functions.py contains, as the name suggests, some core functions for the project.

arrows.py, compilation.py, and rotations3.py are the files to run to generate sample images.
